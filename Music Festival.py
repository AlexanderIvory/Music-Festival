The return of the Australian music festival: A comprehensive list of Aussie music festivals in 2022
Sick of looking for details of Aussie music festivals in 2022? Tone Deaf has you covered. We've got a comprehensive festival list right here.

Lunar New Year Festival to bring live music and comedy to Chatswood

03.02.2022
The past two years have dealt a series of massive blows to the Australian music festival scene and music fans alike.

From the devastating cancellation of Bluesfest less than 24-hours before the event to the postponement of Splendour in the Grass for two years running, the Aussie music festival has been all but decimated during COVID.

With state and international borders opening and things – hopefully – looking up for 2022, festivals are rescheduling and new events are popping up all over the country.

While some are currently not going ahead as expected – Groovin’ only has three dates instead of the usual six, for now – we are welcoming back some international headliners and heralding the birth of new events.

With that in mind, Tone Deaf has put together a comprehensive list of music festivals hitting Aussie shores in 2022:

# Music-Festival
Code that scans a (very) large body of text to find a phrase that ticks off certain criteria. 
This is modelled off a radio challenge to find an artist that played at a concert with key characteristics in the name. 
The beginning of the code is ctrl+a,c,v of a website with a list of all music concerts that year with artists. 
The code slices up the article to the information we want, eventually finding the artist. 
Due to complications of the English language and interesting name choices, the code can only narrow it down so the user can make the final choice. 
Before you ask: no, I did not know what an API was before creating this.
